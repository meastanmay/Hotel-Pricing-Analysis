# Hotel-Pricing-Analysis
This was the capstone project I worked on during my internship at [Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow](https://www.iiml.ac.in/)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Introduction/Objective:
Tourism has now become a significant industry in India. It is a sunrise industry, an employment generator, and a significant source of foreign exchange for the country. Tourism in India is the third largest foreign exchange earner of the country. The booming tourism industry has had a cascading effect on the hospitality sector with an increase in occupancy ratios and average room rates. In this regard, suitably pricing hotel rooms and related services for tourists and travelers becomes a crucial issue. This is because a hotel’s price reflects an assessment of the value tourists see and their willingness to pay for the hotel’s rooms and services. . In this project, we investigate what factors the hotel industry charges tourists for the Rent of a Room and also how various factors affect the quality of Hotel Services provided by various Hotels across 42 different cities across India.
